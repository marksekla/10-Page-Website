   <p>Great Sphinx of Giza, a massive limestone statue of a reclining sphinx that is situated in Giza, Egypt, and shows King Khafre's visage, most likely dates from his reign (2575 B.C. - 2465 B.C.). It is undoubtedly the most well-known example of sphinx art and one of Egypt's most well-known sites. The Great Sphinx is one of the biggest sculptures in the world, at 66 feet (20 metres) tall and 240 feet (73 metres) long. It has a lion-like body and a human head with a crown on it. Since the Great Sphinx was made from a single block of limestone, it is possible that it was painted throughout. Using stone hammers and copper chisels, 100 workers would have needed roughly three years to complete the monument, according to some estimations. The Sphinx is the embodiment of royal authority and the guardian of the temple entrances. It stands in for Ra-Horakhty, a mighty sun deity.</p>
