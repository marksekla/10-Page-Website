   <p>The biggest collection of Pharaonic artefacts in the whole world may be found in the Egyptian Museum, which is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. A sizable collection from the Predynastic to the Greco-Roman eras is on exhibit in the museum. The building's architect was chosen through a first-of-its-kind international competition in 1895, which was won by French architect Marcel Dourgnon. The museum, which Khedive Abbas Helmy II opened in 1902, is now a famous landmark in the heart of Cairo and is the repository for some of the most spectacular ancient works of art. The complete tombs of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette celebrating the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under one pharaoh are only a few of the museum's priceless items. This collection is unmatched. The magnificent sculptures of the ancient monarchs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, who constructed the pyramids on the Giza plateau, are also kept at the museum. This very large museum is completed with a rich collection of papyri, sarcophagi, and jewellery, among other items.</p>
