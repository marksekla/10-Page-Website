   <p>The final of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is a defining icon of Egypt. It was constructed during a twenty-year period during the rule of King Khufu of the 4th Dynasty, and is situated on the Giza plateau close to the contemporary city of Cairo. The Great Pyramid maintained the record for the world's highest man-made construction for more than 3,000 years before the Eiffel Tower was finished in Paris, France, in 1889. This record is unlikely to be surpassed. The pyramid is made up of more than two million stone pieces and has a height of 479 feet and a base of 754 feet. Some of these stones are so large and heavy that it appears logistically impossible to lift them and place them exactly, even by ancient standards.</p>
