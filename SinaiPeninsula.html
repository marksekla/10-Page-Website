   <p>A sparsely inhabited desert region between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea is the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. At its southernmost point, the Sharm el-Sheikh resort serves as a base for snorkelling and scuba diving in and surrounding Ras Mohammed National Park's reefs. Inland, close to the ancient Mount Sinai, whose 2,285m top is known for its dawn vistas, lies the 6th-century St. Catherine's Monastery. Its northern two-thirds are an arid plateau known as the Sinai Desert, while its southern part is hilly and includes Mount Sinai. It has been inhabited since prehistoric times and is well-known for being the alleged path of the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt and the location where Moses was given the Ten Commandments by God.</p>
