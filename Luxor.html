   <p>The ancient Egyptian city of Thebes' location is located near Luxor, a contemporary city in Upper Egypt. As the remains of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor are located inside the contemporary city, Luxor has sometimes been referred to as the "world's finest open-air museum." The structures, temples, and tombs of the west bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens, are located just across the River Nile. It is home to some of the most magnificent temples, including the Valley of the Kings, the Karnak Temple, the Queen Hatshepsut Temple, and the Luxor Temple, which is home to some of the most amazing antiquities and ruins. Each year, thousands of visitors from all over the world come to Luxor to see its monuments, considerably boosting the local economy.</p>
