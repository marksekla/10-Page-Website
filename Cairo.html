   <p>Egypt's capital, Cairo, is one of the biggest cities in Africa. Cairo has been located in the same location on the banks of the Nile for more than 1,000 years. It is largely on the eastern coast, around 500 miles (800 km) downstream from the Aswan High Dam. Cairo, which is situated in the northeast of the nation, serves as the entry point for travellers to the Nile delta, where the lower Nile divides into the Damietta and Rosetta branches. The Cairo Muafazah and other neighbourhoods, some of which are located in other governorates like Al-Jizah and Qalubiyyah, make up metropolitan Cairo. Cairo is a city of stark physical differences. Tall buildings and luxuriant greenery coexist on the seashore that has been well-irrigated. However, browns and ochres are the predominate colours of the terrain and structures in the older inland areas to the east, which are located beneath the foothills of the Eastern Desert and the rocky promontories of the Muqaam Hills and the Al-Jabal al-Amar.</p>
