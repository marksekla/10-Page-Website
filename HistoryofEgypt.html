   <p>Over 8,000 years ago, hunters and fisherman became the first humans to dwell along the Nile's banks. They started to establish towns and villages after learning how to cultivate crops and keep livestock. They learnt to sail boats and engaged in commerce with their neighbours. A civilisation had emerged by 3000 B.C. A strong monarch, later known as a pharaoh, united the kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt in 3100 B.C. Huge pyramids, temples, and other structures were constructed by these monarchs. They also took over other nations. Egypt had fragmented into several pieces and was in decline by 1000 B.C. Strong neighbours invaded Egypt and seized its territory. Egypt came under Roman rule in 31 B.C. Muslim armies conquered Egypt in the year 640 and established Cairo as its current capital. They held power for many centuries. Egypt joined the Ottoman Turkish Empire in the sixteenth century.</p>
